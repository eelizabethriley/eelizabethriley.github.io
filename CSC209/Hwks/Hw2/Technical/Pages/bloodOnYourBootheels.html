We jump 'round the ring and we loosen your reins
I heard the man was roamin' free, now he's livin' in chains
Woah woah, everywhere I got the world in tow, oh
No matter where I turn, I got to carry the load

Well, shoeshine brother thinks I'm so naive
Lookin' at me thinkin' I got somethin' hidden up my sleeve
No, ch√©ri, I'm cool as can be
I got no money, but I'm always feelin' free, free, free

So what you think you're doin'? Who do you think you are?
Drinkin' bottles of whiskey, smokin' Cuban cigars
Think if you act like a man, you can alter this wheel?
You can't make it in this world without that blood on your bootheels

Well, get your head right, a-put your keys up on the table
While they polishin' their pistols and they're staring out the windows
Wonderin' who's a-comin' down my gate- hey, pick a side
Love, tie your boots up and then get your ass in line

Well, see them swindlers [?]
It's a wonder that they'll ever see the light of day
With people like you walkin' on the street
If police were policin', then I probably wouldn't have to follow him
Every step of his feet
They look me in the eye, and they look me in the face
And they review my fate, say my name, race, and age
Son, grab your gun and run, oh, you got no appeal
You can't make it in this world without that blood on your bootheels

[Instrumental]

I have a dream too, you think I ain't got dreams?
When I close my eyes and sleep, only thing I can believe in
My religion, I envision murderin' everythin' livin'
While I'm cookin' up my goddamn future in the kitchen

What makes you all my favorite mess
A vision of a blackened head bent over a fence
Took a beatin' to his head, forty bullets to his chest
And with one hand on the Bible, claimed it was in self-defense

I read all those books, yeah, I seen all them films
I bet you got a pretty degree up in your windowsill
Well, leave me out of it, people like me don't live to feel
We can make it in this world without that blood on our bootheels
