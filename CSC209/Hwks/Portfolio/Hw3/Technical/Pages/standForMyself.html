  <pre>
[Verse 1]
I understand why you close your eyes
Why you deaf your ears, oh I realize now
You wanna feel nothing, just like I was
A coward in the shadows, no view from above

[Verse 2]
Now I'm alive, it's hard to explain
It took this much time and took this much pain
You can get here if you're willing
Let go of yourself for a new beginning

[Chorus]
It was easier to sit than stand for myself
It was easy to give in than stand for myself

[Verse 3]
I know why you hide away
Why you keep so quiet, mind what you say now
You think you're too much, too hot to handle
You're stronger than anyone but still so fragile

[Chorus]
It was easier to sing than stand for myself
It was easier to give in than stand for myself
It was hard enough to go and live on
I was so tired, trying to belong
I was lost in the city, you could see it in my eyes
But I was still a dreamer in the middle of the night

[Outro]
I'm alive, alive, I'm alive
I used to be nothing like you
I used to feel nothing like you
Now I'm alive, alive, I'm alive
I used to be nothing like you
I used to feel nothing like you
Now I'm alive, alive, I'm alive
I used to be nothing like you
I used to feel nothing like you
Now I'm alive, alive, I'm alive!
Ooh yeah!
Ooh ooh
Ooh coo coo
Ooh coo coo
Ooh coo coo
Ooh coo coo
