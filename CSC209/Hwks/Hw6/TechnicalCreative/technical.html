<h1>Homework 6: Technical and Creative</h1>

<p>I worked on some of the features in this program simultaneously, but in total I spent about 8 hours on the core technical features and about 2 on additional creative features.
</p>
<p>The final program in level 4 implements the rules of the game of life on a dynamically resizeable grid drawn on a canvas. By default, the canvas is full of dead cells represented by black and can be populated as follows with red alive cells. There is a "randomize" button that switches cells to alive or dead to provide a starting state, as well as an "invert" button that flips cells to the opposite state. The "next" button progresses the generation of the game. The "clear" button sets all cells to dead again. Adjusting the width or height sliders and clicking the "set" button will resize the canvas and clear it. The "play" button will progress generations continuously until the "stop" button is pressed.</p>
