[Verse 1]
I was sitting in the back seat
Looking out the window
Riding in the fast lane
Not sure who was driving
I blink my eyes
The scene is gone

[Verse 2]
I was waving to an old me
Feeling kind of lonely
Don't see too many faces of the friends that used to know me
Close my eyes
Smile on

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever comes, won't let you go
I'm off for now
I'll see you soon

[Chorus]
Everybody's trying to get on, get on
Taste a little bit of heaven, heaven
I feel that presence when I'm with you
Oh

[Verse 3]
I have moments, heart of concrete
Cold and looking for heat
Far away with no place
Safe for all my soft dreams
Pull me in, calm the storm
Feel the warmth inside my mind again
Thinking of you I'm again
Lifted to a place where I can see and know I'm on again
Raise the light back with your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever comes, won't let you go
I won't let you go
When I'm drifting off I'll see you soon
Oh

[Chorus]
Everybody's trying to get on, get on
Taste a little bit of heaven, heaven
I feel that presence when I'm with you
Oh
Everybody's trying to get on, get on
Taste a little bit of heaven, heaven
I feel that presence when I'm with you
Oh
